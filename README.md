# home-manager
This is my home-manager repository.
It is structured into the following concepts:

- flake.nix bundles and exposes the config
- hosts: Describe the configuration of a physical or virtual machine
- modules: Contains the configuration for single programs
- roles: Bundles programs by their use type (e.g. development, gaming, etc.)
